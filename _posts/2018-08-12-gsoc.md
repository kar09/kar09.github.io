My first experience towards building software that changed perception on what lies ahead in the world of software devlopment. GSoC 2018 did help me become a Machine Learning Engineer even though there was no ML involved in my project. It was the data at scale that opened a new horizon for me. Without data there is no ML and most of the time an ML engineer is just finding what's wrong with the data and correcting it using various data mainupulation techniques. It's easier to deal with CSVs that fit on a single machine but when it comes to dealing with big data, and carry out data mainupulation efficiently is a challenging task. Clustering data using a rule based approach did give me experience on how to work with big data and build systems that can scale.
