Wrote [Effects of changing hyperperimeters](https://www.kaggle.com/kartikeyash/effects-of-changing-hyperperimeters-90-2) on kaggle to understand the working of different classifiers and understanding the math, to get an understanding from where the hyperperimeters appear in different sk-learn models.

Some hyperperimeters might be more intutive than those appear to be, only understanding math behind the origin can
give us those insights.
